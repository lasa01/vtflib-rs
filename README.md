# vtflib

Safe Rust wrapper for VTFLib.

Supports all VTF functionality. VMT functionality is not implemented.

Needs more testing and examples.

See [vtflib-sys](https://github.com/lasa01/vtflib-sys) on how to make the package find VTFLib.
Alternatively, you can enable the `static` feature to automatically build a statically linked VTFLib.
Keep in mind that VTFLib is LGPL-licensed if you decide to do this.
